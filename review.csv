Happy waiters and servers and the food was delicious. The chorizo dip is so flavorful and the steak fajita chimi was to die for. Such tender and flavorful steak. Definitely recommend","5 star rating"

There was a good number of tables occupied in the large dining room. When our server brought our drinks we ordered Guacamole dip, to eat with the complementary chips &amp; salsa. That was a small portion for the price. Then we ordered our entrees: Fish tacos, Shrimp cocktail, Mixed Fajitas, Sopa de Pollo. 1 of the 3 fish tacos has only 1 small strip of fish, compared with the other 2 tacos that were more filled, so consistency was not achieved. For the Fajitas we asked for extra rice instead of sour cream &amp; beans. No big issues with any of the orders. <br>This chain does not have a location near our home (this one was 30 min away) so we won't likely be back unless we're in the area for another reason.","4 star rating"

I know majority of the front of house staff because they've been there since o started going which is great! <br>The chips and salsa are always fresh and I've never been disappointed in a margarita. <br>If you are hesitant to give it a try, don't be. They have an amazing deal in Groupon for a sis punted experience m. You WILL NOT be disappointed.","5 star rating"

I ordered a take out &amp; when I got there, the register guy was watching TV while I am standing there until one of the waitresses hollered at him to check me out. Then he walked a way pointing to a table where my food to pick it up myself.","3 star rating"

The food to me as a Mexican American was below par. Chips were stale and salsa tasted like marinara sauce. Beans and rice, a Mexican staple is not included in all entrees. To me, this restaurant is the third option if you're Mexican dining in Wentzville. .","2 star rating"

The combo is my ""go to"" along side a medium size raspberry margarita with a sugar rim. The service is always quick and fast. Never a long wait to be seated nor for your food to arrive.","4 star rating"
